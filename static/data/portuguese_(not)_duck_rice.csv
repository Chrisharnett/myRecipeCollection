2. In a food processor, process water, oil, apple cider vinegar, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, white pepper and tumeric. Add nutritional yeast and pea protein. Process until smooth, ~ 30 seconds.
3. Add vital wheat gluten and pulse to combine. Process on low for 5 minutes. Your food processor may need breaks to avoid overheating.
4. Divide dough into 4 pieces. Try not to overhandle seitan. Roll into an 8"" rope, fold in half and twist together so it's about 6 inches long. Wrap in in cheesecloth and tie with twine. Set aside and rest while broth is prepared.
5. In a large pot, add broth ingredients (just the zest of the orange and the green top of the leek, save the rest for later). Bring to a boil and reduce heat to simmer. 
6. Add seitan and stew very gently 15 minutes.
7. After 15 minutes, cover and simmer 45 minutes. Remove from broth and allow to cool. Save the broth for later!
8. Pull apart and shred. You'll need about half for the duck-rice and the rest can be frozen for later.
9. Heat oven to 350F.
10. Heat oil in a pan. Saut√© leek and onion until soft, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and mix until aromatic. 
11. Add rice and fry about 5 minutes. Add 400ml of the reserved broth and cook 15 minutes, until rice has cooked.
12. Stir in the shredded seitan and reserved orange juice.
13. Transfer to an oiled casserole dish. Top with vegan chorizo and cook in hot oven 20 - 25 minutes, until rice is crispy and golden. Garnish with mint leaves and orange slices.",portuguese_(not)_duck_rice.jpeg
